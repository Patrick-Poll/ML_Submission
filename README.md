# ML_Submission
## Patrick Pollock, Yann Ebling

A repository containind the trained model for the machine learning project tournament.
Since the model file was too large to submit it directly to MaMPf, we decided to upload it here, and submit the link. The commit history shows, that there were no changes made after the submission deadline of September 23rd, 16:00 pm.
The submission consists of the model uip file (my-saved-model.zip) which unzips to a .pt file and the python files for callbacks and auxiliary functions. The auxiliary functions are standalone functions which are used in callbacks, but are separated to obtain a better structure.
The submission passed the Docker compatibility test.
